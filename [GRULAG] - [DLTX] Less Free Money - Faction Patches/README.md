# [DLTX] Less Free Money - Faction Patches
[DLTX] Less Free Money - Faction Patches

Addition one of a multi-part series on reducing the amount of 'free money' in the zone.

Simply reduces the base-price for Faction patches from 650 to 100. (In my game's difficulty settings the sale-price went from 65 to 10)

Faction patches sell for way too much, and after some time can break the economy in my opinion because you almost always get one per kill, so eventually you just amass a significant
amount of money for something that is way over-valued considering how abundant they are.

It's basically free money. Bare in mind using this addon will make your game more difficult because you won't have as much readily-disposable income.

DLTX'd for max compatibility.

Enjoy
