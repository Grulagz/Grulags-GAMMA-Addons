My Personal MCM DLTX'd values

This is a DLTX'd MCM file i use to over-ride any and all values, so that any changes i add in here, persist through updates to GAMMA no matter what.

For more guidance on how this works, see; https://www.moddb.com/mods/stalker-anomaly/addons/dltxs-persistent-mcm-configuration

This is just my own settings/config, but if anything can be gained of insight, is how i play my game and what settings i like to use on my playthroughs.
