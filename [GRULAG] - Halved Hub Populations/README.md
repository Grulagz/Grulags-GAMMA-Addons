# Halved Hub Populations
Halved Hub Populations

What this does is set the 'Allowed Population' (Squads) factor in various areas that are considered relatively populated, to a number that's either half or slightly above half.

What the intended affect is, is that there are less squads in heavily populated areas, (Such as Rostok) so that performance is better.

They don't 'not exist' , they simply get denied from going to the idle zones they normally do.

Here's an example;  

Let's say Cordon has Population=3, that means that "how ever many zones that can be idled by a squad or members of a squad" in cordon, can only have up to 3 squads at any one time in or spread across those areas.

If we drop this value to 1, now only 1 squad can populate any of those idles spots combined.

The intended effect is that this basically means that any other stalkers that go to those spots go "ohdearyme! my bad, there seems to be no room!"  because =1 and not =3, therefore there's no room so they either don't go there to begin with or they get there and go elsewhere, or just don't even go to that spot and wander the wilds.
