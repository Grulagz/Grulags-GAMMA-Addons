# Halved Hub Populations
Halved Hub Populations

What this does is set the 'Allowed Population' (Squads) factor in various areas that are considered relatively populated, to a number that's either half or slightly above half.

What the intended affect is, is that there are less squads in heavily populated areas, (Such as Rostok) so that performance is better.

They don't 'not exist' , they simply get denied from going to the idle zones they normally do.

Here's an example;  

Let's say Cordon has Population=3, that means that "how ever many zones that can be idled by a squad or members of a squad" in cordon, can only have up to 3 squads at any one time in or spread across those areas.

If we drop this value to 1, now only 1 squad can populate any of those idles spots combined.

The intended effect is that this basically means that any other stalkers that go to those spots go "ohdearyme! my bad, there seems to be no room!"  because =1 and not =3, therefore there's no room so they either don't go there to begin with or they get there and go elsewhere, or just don't even go to that spot and wander the wilds.

When that spot becomes free again, either by the squad going away for some reason, getting killed, or just doing something else, when that spot is free, it's able to be taken up by another squad, or however many squads until the population limit is reached.


THIS addon, goes and checks "How many squads can be in each area" and reduces them by half in most cases, and less in others.

The end result should mean that collectively, TOWNS/BASES that the population is reduced, that there's just less squads there because they've been halved, so you should see less squads/stalkers/groups in the areas, thus increasing performance.

Most noticeable would be Rostok, where the main outposts have less room for squads, so instead of 2 or 3 squads there's now 1 or 2 less.

The cool thing about this is, is you can just change it to whatever you want. Want Cordon to be crazy populated? try setting the value to like 10 or 20. Over time, you should see more squads move in and there will be a general ambience of more sqauds in the base.


There's also a Minimum population that can be set. it's not in every file, but if set, means that the town tries to keep that amount of squads as a minimum at all times. When they die or get killed, another will see an opportunity to move in because that's the minimum set.
