Halved Hub Populations

What this does is set the 'Allowed Population' (Squads) factor in various areas that are considered relatively populated, to a number that's either half or slightly above half.

What the intended affect is, is that there are less squads in heavily populated areas, (Such as Rostok) so that performance is better.
