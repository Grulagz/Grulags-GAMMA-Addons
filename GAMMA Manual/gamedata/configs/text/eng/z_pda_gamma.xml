			%c[pda_white]Radiation \n \n %c[ui_gray_1] 

			\n• GAMMA features dynamic radiations and revamped radiation damages system.
			\n• New random radiation patches are spawned when starting a new game.
			\n• Radiations will slowly reduce your health (much slower than Vanilla) and will reduce your max stamina. 
			\n• The more irradiated you are, the more probably critical organs will be damaged by rads. This results in the 
			\n player character coughing and loosing significant health amount.
			\n
			\n• If you hit a radiation patch and the icon is beeping at the bottom left, don't panick. 
			\n• If you start coughing, it's time to check your dosimeter. If you have rads above 500mS, it will slowly kill you, 
			\n think about using an anti rad or several cigarettes. If the icon is yellow, use a strong anti rad as soon as possible.
			\n
			\n• The more to the north you go, the more dangerous the radiations will be. Be sure to have a good gas mask before going 
			\n into northern areas. Army Warehouses without a gas mask can kill you if you just hit one bad radiation patch without 
			\n proper anti radiation medication.

			\n• The northern a stash is in the Zone, the better the loot.
			\n• Storing stuff in stashes is safe : it won't be looted by NPCs.

			\n•	Shift+T performs a "Take All", good for looting quickly.
			\n•	You don't need every medical items to heal your body. Mark the most important ones as favorite for an easy access.
			\n• Water bottles are better weight-wise than cantines to quench thirst. Keep the cantines in your main stash to cook with.

			\n• Mutant parts and meat don't weight much so keeping some in your inventory will give you goodwill and stashes quicker.
			\n 
			\n• Crafting tools don't weight much and you can right click "use" them to open the crafting and repair menu just like a vice
			\n to craft what you need on-the-go.
			\n 
			\n• Ammunition can be quite heavy, but disassembled ammo parts are very lightweight. Keep these parts and craft ammo with

			\n
			\n• You can right click and mark some items as "Favorite" and others as "Junk". This will give you an easy access to the

			\n peaceful, with paid PMCs to ensure the security and limit fights between existing factions. During that time the 
			\n Monolith grew stronger again, and in 2018, the Monolith is back, reactivated the miracle machine and the brain

			%c[pda_white]Money \n \n %c[ui_gray_1] 

			\n In GAMMA money is of the essence, especially in the beginning. 
			\n There are fast ways to make cash, namely doing tasks without picking up fights, selling mutant parts or selling 
			\n artefacts to the ecologists.
			\n
			\n You'll find yourself often spending money in healing items and that's intended. The more you play, the better 
			\n the toolkits you'll have and the easier it will be to repair good gear and craft items, which will save money 
			\n and make fights easier, thus helping you saving even more money.
			\n 
			\n In mid game, you'll inevitably get loads of money. This can be used to upgrade your equipment, or invest in 
			\n expensive AP ammo.
			\n 			
			\n You can also buy detectors and NVGs at traders... Or craft them and save some money.
			\n Maintaining an exoskeleton armor will also be a money sink since you need to often buy expensive exo batteries 
			\n in numbers.
			\n 			
			\n Better healing items are also a must to have easier fights, using stimpacks will greatly help you in tense fights.

			\n Armor plates belt attachments are on par with artefacts protection, reaching about 15% ballistic and explosive protection. 
			\n They do not have electric res penalties anymore. They do not protect you from mutants anymore.
			\n Plates can't be bought at merchants anymore.
			\n Basic Kevlar armor plates are obtained via questlines (basic tier 1 plate) or crafted from scratch using armor parts.
			\n
			\n Armor plates can be upgraded via the crafting system:
			\n•     - The tier 1 Kevlar plate can be upgraded to tier 2 Kevlar plate with lots of armor parts.
			\n•     - The tier 2 Kevlar plate can be upgraded to tier 3 metallic plate with lots of armor parts.
			\n•     - The tier 3 metallic plate can be upgraded to tier 4 metallic plate with lots of armor parts.
			\n
			\n This system should push the player to scavenge armor parts for longer.
			\n Armor parts used in this system are conveniently marked with a hammer and pincer icon for easy sorting and looting.
			\n This should prevent players that don't want to engage in artefacts hunting to not die miserably once they fight monolith 
			\n and sin in the north.

			\n sure to check them whenever you move around them!
			\n 
			\n New artefacts quality system: artefacts spawn with a random low condition (or "quality") to mimic that every artefact 
			\n is different in their strength.
			\n 
			\n%c[pda_yellow]New toolkit, the Artefacts Melter:%c[ui_gray_1]
			\n• Buy it a Sakharov or Herman for about 30k RU. You can craft artefacts by using:
			\n Functions: (right click > Fuse Artefacts) and empower them with (right click > Empower artefacts). 
			\n• Every action you take with the artefacts melter will consume some uses. 
			\n• You can refill the melter by holding Left Alt key and dragging it on top of any artefact.
			\n• Melting artefacts takes 1 use from the melter. You can alternatively buy another melter.
			\n• Keeping an empty melter on you is a good way to replenish it on your way through the zone with unwanted artefacts.
			\n 
			\n%c[pda_yellow]Artefacts Empowering:%c[ui_gray_1]

			\n%c[pda_yellow]Artefacts Crafting:%c[ui_gray_1]
			\n• Access the craft menu as usual. There will be a new crafting subsection: Artefacts. 
			\n• This will allow you to convert multiple artefacts of a given tier to the tier above:
			\n• Junk > Tier 1 (7mS).
			\n• Tier 1 > Tier 2 (12mS).
			\n• Tier 2 > Tier 3 (23mS).

			%c[pda_white]Energy Management \n \n %c[ui_gray_1] 

			\n Energy in GAMMA is a balancing act between travel, food, drinks, medicine and sleep.
			\n
			\n You character will be tired at the end of the day. You have to sleep replenish your energy. 
			\n You can only sleep if you are tired enough. Using sleeping pills will allow you to forcefully
			\n sleep, this will not replenish your energy.
			\n
			\n Depending on how the day was, you'll get tired faster or not. Eating copious meals and using
			\n sleep inducing medicines will allow you to feel tired and get rest at the end of the day. 
			\n 
			\n However if you are eating small meals, and use energy drinks or caffeine tablets often, 
			\n you'll have a hard time to be tired enough to sleep at the end of the day.
			\n 
			\n You'll have a chance to wake up early. Be sure to try to sleep more than what you intend to 
			\n sleep the correct amount of time. Sometimes you'll oversleep.
			\n 
			\n Having a sleeping bag + sleeping mat will reduce the chance of waking up early
			\n Vodka or Beers can help you sleep as well.

			\n• Traders will mostly sell supplies and some accessories.

			\n• You can increase traders supply level by doing tasks for the trader's faction.
			\n The goodwill thresholds are: 
			\n 500, 1000, 1500 and 2000 goodwill. 
			\n
			\n This is a reliable way to secure a steady income of quality ammunitions.
			\n
			\n Traders are either of the WP (Warsaw Pact) or NATO type. This will influence the kind of supplies they sell
			\n (ammo and attachments mostly).
			\n 
			\n NATO factions: Mercenaries, Clear Sky, Freedom, UNISG.
			\n WP factions: Military, Loner, Duty, Bandits, Renegades, Monolith.
			\n 
			\n This also influences NPCs loadouts of factions, ie: Monolith NPCs have ~50% chance to have a NATO or WP gun.
			\n
			\n Some traders sell very specific items, like Prof. Sakharov and Hermann sell the Artefacts Melter, 
			\n a GAMMA specific toolkit that let's you empower and craft artefacts (and you can break artefacts with 
			\n it to replenish the melter's power). They also sell exoskeletons' PSU recipes at Supplies Lv 5.

	<string id="article_gamma_repgun_text">
		<text>
			%c[pda_white]Repairs for Guns \n \n %c[ui_gray_1] 

			\n Guns must be repaired to progress since you can't buy them from traders with GAMMA Economy. 
			\n Indeed, the EU and UN decided to put a stop at the bloodshed in the Zone as well as guns smuggling 
			\n from the Zone to the nearby countries by trying to limit guns traffic, and no faction want to have 
			\n problems with more Private Military Companies paid by these organisms, PMCs are already crawling enough 
			\n within the Zone.
			\n
			\n You can loot guns from stashes or dead stalkers though, and that's how you will make it to the North in one piece.
			\n Most guns will be destroyed and you'll need to fix them or they will jam very often.
			\n Keep in mind that gun's condition is separated from parts conditions. Gun condition represents how clean a gun is 
			\n and will change parts degradation and promote jamming. Jams are coming from the actual gun parts. Repairing the gun
			\n condition will not repair the gun's parts. Each part must be repaired individually. Each part affects the gun jamming 
			\n frequency but  the barrel. The barrel changes the damage the gun deals, to some extent.
			\n
			\n To repair guns you have two ways:
			\n - Collect parts for the weapon that are above 60% condition and repair them with the appropriate tool to 100% condition
			\n (ramrod, Multitool... Check the part's details). Drag and drop the repaired parts on the gun, it will limit the chance
			\n of the gun jamming. Moving parts in and out of the gun will will make it less clean. Barrels can't be replaced that way, 
			\n you need the appropriate toolkit and replace it in the crafting / repair menu (launched in a vice or after right clicking 
			\n and "use" a toolkit).
			\n
			\n - If a gun has a barrel with a condition above 60% condition, you can buy a cleaning kit from mechanics and right click the 
			\n gun > clean barrel. Same for other parts. It's an easy way to get good guns early since you can buy cleaning kit without any
			\n toolkits unlocked.
			\n 
			\n - Alternatively, you can get the appropriate repair kit, right click the gun and "maintain parts" it will allow you to replace 
			\n the guns parts for 100% condition parts automatically, but will consume a repair kit use. It can even replace barrels. These 
			\n kits can be crafted or bought to mechanics once you have the appropriate toolkit (basic, advanced or expert).
			\n
			\n You must also clean the gun using cleaning equipment or paying a mechanic to do it. Cleaning a gun will not repair its parts 
			\n but will prevent parts to be degraded when using the gun.

			\n any toolkit and "use" it. To replace armor parts you'll need the appropriate repair kit in your inventory. 
			\n Replacing parts will not consume repair kits uses. From 50% and above, armors can be repaired directly using repair kits. 
			\n Below that you'll need to repair parts. Be sure to maintain you armor condition.
			\n

		<text>
			%c[pda_white]Ballistics System \n \n %c[ui_gray_1]
			
			\n GAMMA uses Grok's Balanced Overhaul Of Ballistic System. 
			\n It changes notably the bullets and armor penetration from PLAYER to NPCs (not the other way around) using EFT ammunition
			\n system as an inspiration. The goal is to have a more realistic ballistic system where you must take into account the armor 
			\n of your enemy and the ammo type you are using.
			\n
			\n Ammo Armor Penetration (AP) power is compared to the limb armor of the opponent. 
			\n If the AP power > limb armor, damages are applied. If AP power is less than limb armor, no damages are applied and limb armor is reduced based on AP power. 
			\n Ammo with low AP power thus need to break an opponents limb armor before starting doing damage. AP ammo are thus required to kill heavily armored targets. 
			\n FMJ and HP ammo will still work, but the enemy armor must be destroyed by many of these bullets to start doing damage.
			\n Legs and face armors are reduced.
			\n 
			\n%c[pda_yellow]AP ammo (Armor Penetration): %c[ui_gray_1]
			\n• Expensive but will defeat any endgame heavily armored target. 
			\n• They are end game ammo, don't use them against lightly armored targets or you will waste money.
			\n
			\n%c[pda_yellow]FMJ ammo (Full Metal Jacket):%c[ui_gray_1] 
			\n• Cheap and must be used to kill lightly armored targets or if you don't have the money to buy good ammo against armored targets.
			\n
			\n%c[pda_yellow]HP ammo (Hollow-Point): %c[ui_gray_1]
			\n• A bit more expensive than FMJ and must be used to kill mutants.
			\n
			\n Sniper ammo are actually very powerful, but also very expensive. 
			\n Lapua will most likely one shot most ennemies to the chest if you can afford them.
			\n Buckshots will work as inexpensive, early game ammo against stalkers. Forget about them mid and late game. Good for Mutants, bad for Exo's.
			\n Slugs are good to kill mutants and stalkers alike. AP Slugs are good only against stalkers.
			\n
			\n Some ammo are much more useful against mutants: HP ammo, .357 magnum, .45 Hydrashock, buckshots, slugs, 7.62x25 Pst.
