# [DLTX] Better Explosives
[DLTX] Better Explosives


This is a merge of 2 addons;
Defuse & Pickup explosives
Realistic Explosives DLTX

This results in explosives being able to be placed and picked up (by crouching) and the damage and particles are more, to try to be a bit more realistic, so that they are actually more useful and lethal.

Note; This can affect FPS if used, as the particles are many and can tank FPS in rare scenarios, such as a bunch of bodies or similar crazy dense areas.
