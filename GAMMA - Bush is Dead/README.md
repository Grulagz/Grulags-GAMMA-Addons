Bush is Dead

GAMMA got a change to the gameplay where NPCs can now see through bushes.
So, it's only fair that you can see through them too.

Makes all bushes (or i think all!) a 'dead' texture.

Credit to the maker of DeadZone, that's where i got this from. I didn't make it, i just uploaded it. Happy to remove if he would like me to.
