# Rarer Trades and Tasks from random Stalkers
Rarer Trades and Tasks from random Stalkers

Significantly reduces the chance of random Stalkers offering trade or tasks.

Why?
This is a personal tweak i made in conjunction with other addons i have made to make my game more difficult/challenging.

This means you need to talk to more stalkers to get things, whether it be someone to palm-off your junk to, or someone to give you some work. 
Times are tough for the zone, stalkers have less to trade, and less work available.
