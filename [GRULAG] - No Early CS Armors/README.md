# No Early CS Armors
No Early CS Armors

All this mod does is removes the first and second armor you get for completing clearsky quests.

Why:
I felt these armors were too quick and too easy to acquire, and always led me to play the same way every time by going to swamp and completing the clearsky quests straight away to get some ok-ish armor.

This mod is an alteration of New Storylines (DLTX minimodpack) by Demonized - It's his mod but just with the 2 armor rewards for clearsky taken out.
