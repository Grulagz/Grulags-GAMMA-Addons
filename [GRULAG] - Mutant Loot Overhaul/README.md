# [DLTX] Mutant Loot Overhaul
[DLTX] Mutant Loot Overhaul

This is a merge and re-work of two of my separate addons;

- "Less Free Money - Mutants"
and
The mutants component [mutant_loot.ltx] of:
"Rarer Corpse Loot"


Goals:
- Make "Common" parts less valuable.
- Make "Rare" parts more rarer, and more valuable.
- Make "Very Rare" parts very rare, and more valuable.
- Make Meats less valuable (due to being radiated and raw) (Value reduced on all meats by around about half) (Meat rarities weren't really touched)... yet..?
- Halves, and in some cases more than halves the values of pelts.

What this addon will do;

Increase difficulty and make hunting for high-tier game more rewarding, while making the most common loot from mutants a little less valuable. (So you need more of it to get rich)

In addition, this also carries across the original changes of the "Rarer Corpse Loot" version i made where i reduced the drop rate of medicines and other misc valuables to be less crazy from mutant drops.





Detailed breakdown (For those that are bored enough...)


The numbers on the left are new price, the ones after ; is the old price, and the ;COMMON etc is the rarity, ordered by descending in rarity.
