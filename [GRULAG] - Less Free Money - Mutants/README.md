# [DLTX] Less Free Money - Mutants
[DLTX] Less Free Money - Mutants

Addition two of a multi-part series on reducing the amount of 'free money' in the zone.

Simply reduces the base price for mutant parts, skins, foods, pelts, etc.

This addon effectively halves most mutant loot prices for anything in the list that mutants drop, such as their body parts or pelts or food items.
Version 1 is a bit quick and nasty, really not a lot of great deal of thought behind each reduction, but in time based on how it plays out i might look at making rarer parts worth more, and way more common parts worth even less.

Reason:
Mutant parts are incredibly abundant, and sell for way more than they should considering how common they are. Some are useful, others are not, but regardless they are a part of the multi-dimensional problem
with which contribute to economy blow-out in the game.


Bare in mind using this addon will make your game more difficult because you won't have as much readily-disposable income.

DLTX'd for max compatibility.

Enjoy
