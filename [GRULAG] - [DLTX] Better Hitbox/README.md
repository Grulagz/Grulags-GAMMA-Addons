[DLTX] Better Hitbox

All this does is tweaks the players hitbox to be smaller, so that the actor cannot be hit from behind cover in certain circumstances, because of the smaller radius.
Note that this may -slightly- affect running/climbing in some cases, but it seems to be rare enough for me to not notice or care that much, considering the fix or benefit it provides.
